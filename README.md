## Why Unit Testing? ##
Unit Testing is improving software quality by identifying and resolving defects before they are leaked into production. The main unit testing platforms are MS Test, NUnit or xUnit. Unit testing can be performed on this platforms using different framework. MOQ is one of the unit testing framework which can be used in this platform for unit testing.

## Install Moq ##
You can install “Moq” in your project with MS Test using “NuGet Package Manager” UI or console.

    Install-Package Moq

## How to Use Moq ##

To use the Moq, it's very easy. Mainly it has 3 steps basic process.
	
1. Creating the object of user class.
	
    	// Create a mock object of a User class which implements IUser
        var mock = new Moq.Mock<IUser>();

2. Setup the methods of user class as per your need.

		// Configure dummy method so that it return true when it gets any string as parameters to the method.
		mock.Setup(User => User.IsAdmin).Returns(true);

3. Verify that the particular method of the interface was invoked.
 
	    // Verify that the User's MakePayment methods gets called exactly once when IsAdmin property value is true
	    mock.Verify(x => x.MakePayment());
